Beam search:
1. The user input the initial prompt
2. for toke in vocabulary: until the max_seq_length or not all([s[0].endswith(self.target) for s in sequences]) or the lost is less than the loss_stop_min:
    1. Add the token to the initial prompt
    2. Calculate the loss
    3. Choose the top-N sequences based on the loss
    4. Add the top-N injunction sequences to the initial prompt iterratively ,each step you add top-N injunction sequences to the initial prompt from the previous step+injection_addition, injecnction from the vocabulary below,and proccessto the next step
    5. Encoder(inital_prompt+injection_addition + output) -> next_token
    7. train the model with the loss and the token that the beam search algorithm found

3. Return the best from the lasttop-N injunction sequences



TODO:
1. Implement the scoring function that combines the model's predictions with the toxicity and readability scores(find a paper that does this, there is alreedy classification model that does this)
2.AMIT  Implement the beam search algorithm(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o-kdjv7FD0)  AMIT
3. Encoder only model, train the model with the loss and the token that the beam search algorithm found (Take some exsit model and fine tune it)
4. Add option for excat match of the target
